# Hi there, I'm Baelun 👋 

### **Software Engineer @ Delta Electronics (Architecture Dept.)**
**Industrial Data Infrastructure | Performance Engineering | MLOps Aspirant**

I am a Software Engineer in the **Architecture Department** at Delta Electronics. My work revolves around **Technology Scouting** and **Infrastructure Evaluation**. I bridge the gap between Industrial Engineering (IE) logic and scalable Data/AI architectures.

### 🔭 Current Focus: Industrial Data Infrastructure
*At Delta's Architecture Dept., I evaluate and prototype next-gen data platforms for IIoT data landing.*

- **Data Platform POCs**: Designing high-throughput **Kafka-to-ClickHouse-to-S3** pipelines with cold/hot data tiering strategies.
- **Advanced ETL/ELT**: Prototyping multi-source integration (e.g., **MongoDB to ClickHouse**) using **SeaTunnel**, **dltHub (DLT)**, and **PySpark** to assess integration feasibility.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Executing multi-stage **Stress Tests** using mock data to define limits for ClickHouse, Kafka, and specialized data warehouses.
- **Cloud-Native DevEx**: Researching **Tilt, DevPod, and K8s (GKE)** to streamline microservice prototyping and environment consistency.
- **Observability**: Establishing monitoring standards via **Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki**.

### 🧬 Previous Foundation: IE & Computer Vision
*My background in Industrial Engineering and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).*

Integrating Human-Machine Interaction with Machine Learning models.
- **Human Factor Evaluation System:** Developed a full-stack web application using Flask, JavaScript, and Python to automate the assessment of industrial motion patterns.
- **Pose Estimation & Feature Engineering:** Utilized Mediapipe Pose to detect and extract 3D joint coordinates for real-time ergonomic analysis.
- **Comparative Model Analysis:** Trained and optimized multiple supervised learning models (XGBoost, GBM, and K-NN) to predict joint loads, achieving performance benchmarking across different algorithms.
- **HCI Optimization:** Designed intuitive interfaces to visualize model predictions, bridging the gap between raw ML output and industrial usability.

### 🚀 Future Roadmap: Bridging Data & MLOps
*Leveraging my ML background to explore the lifecycle of production AI.*

- **AI Infrastructure**: Prototyping **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** servers and **RAG** systems (LlamaIndex/FAISS) to integrate LLMs with industrial data.
- **Target: MLOps**: Integrating my Data Engineering stack with ML workflows (Model deployment, monitoring, and automated retraining).
